## 1. Network Addressing Concepts

### Socket Address Structures

Socket address structures are fundamental to network programming as they contain all the information needed to identify network endpoints. Different address structures exist for different address families.

#### Generic Socket Address Structure: `struct sockaddr`

```c
struct sockaddr {
    sa_family_t sa_family;    // Address family (AF_INET, AF_INET6, etc.)
    char        sa_data[14];  // Address data with padding
};
```

This is a generic structure designed to be a "one size fits all" container. Socket interface functions like `bind()`, `connect()`, and `accept()` take pointers to this structure type even though you'll actually pass more specific structures cast to this type.

#### IPv4 Socket Address: `struct sockaddr_in`

```c
struct sockaddr_in {
    sa_family_t    sin_family;    // Always AF_INET for IPv4
    in_port_t      sin_port;      // 16-bit port number (in network byte order)
    struct in_addr sin_addr;      // 32-bit IPv4 address
    char           sin_zero[8];   // Padding to match sockaddr size
};

struct in_addr {
    uint32_t       s_addr;        // IPv4 address in network byte order
};
```

This structure is used for IPv4 addresses. The `sin_zero` field is padding to make the structure the same size as `sockaddr` to allow safe casting between the two types.

#### IPv6 Socket Address: `struct sockaddr_in6`

```c
struct sockaddr_in6 {
    sa_family_t     sin6_family;   // Always AF_INET6 for IPv6
    in_port_t       sin6_port;     // 16-bit port number
    uint32_t        sin6_flowinfo; // IPv6 flow information
    struct in6_addr sin6_addr;     // 128-bit IPv6 address
    uint32_t        sin6_scope_id; // Scope ID
};
```

This structure is larger than the generic `sockaddr`. This is why socket functions take a length parameter to handle different address structure sizes.

#### Address Storage: `struct sockaddr_storage`

```c
struct sockaddr_storage {
    sa_family_t  ss_family;     // Address family
    // Implementation-dependent padding and fields
    // to ensure proper alignment and size
};
```

This structure is guaranteed to be large enough to hold any socket address type. It's useful when you don't know what type of address you'll receive (like in `accept()`).

### Address Families

Address families define the format and properties of addresses:

#### AF_INET (IPv4)
- 32-bit addresses (like 192.168.1.1)
- Most common on the internet
- Format: four decimal numbers separated by dots
- Uses `sockaddr_in` structure

#### AF_INET6 (IPv6)
- 128-bit addresses (like 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334)
- Newer standard to address IPv4 address exhaustion
- Format: up to eight hexadecimal fields separated by colons
- Uses `sockaddr_in6` structure

#### AF_UNIX/AF_LOCAL
- Local inter-process communication
- Doesn't use network (communication within same machine)
- Uses filesystem pathnames instead of IP/port
- Uses `sockaddr_un` structure

#### Others
- AF_PACKET: Link layer packets
- AF_BLUETOOTH: Bluetooth connections
- And many more specialized families

### Network Interfaces

A network interface is a connection point between a computer and a network. It can be physical hardware or a virtual connection.

#### Physical Interfaces
- Ethernet (eth0): Wired network connection
- WiFi (wlan0): Wireless network connection
- Cellular (ppp0): Mobile data connection

#### Virtual Interfaces
- Loopback (lo): Special interface for localhost (127.0.0.1)
- VPN tunnels: Created when connecting to VPNs
- Container/virtualization interfaces: For virtual machines or containers

Each interface:
- Has its own IP address(es)
- Can be active or inactive
- Has specific configuration (speed, MTU, etc.)

#### Interface Properties
On Unix/Linux systems, you can see your interfaces with:
```bash
ifconfig   # or
ip addr show
```

### Special Addresses

#### INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0)
`INADDR_ANY` is a special IPv4 address used in server applications that:
- Tells the kernel to accept connections directed to any of the host's IP addresses
- Allows the server to receive packets through any network interface
- Is commonly used in the `bind()` call when setting up server sockets

```c
serveraddr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);  // Listen on all interfaces
```

Using `INADDR_ANY` means: "I'll accept connections coming to any IP address assigned to any network interface on this machine." This is different from binding to a specific interface, which would limit connections to just that interface.

#### Localhost (127.0.0.1)
Localhost refers to the loopback interface with these characteristics:
- Always has IP address 127.0.0.1 in IPv4 (::1 in IPv6)
- Is a virtual network interface that exists only in software
- Traffic sent to localhost never leaves the machine
- Useful for testing and inter-process communication
- Is available even when not connected to any network

```c
serveraddr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_LOOPBACK);  // or inet_addr("127.0.0.1")
```

When you bind to localhost, your service is only accessible from the same machine, not from other computers on the network.

## 2. Socket Interface Functions

### socket()

The `socket()` function creates a new socket.

```c
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
```

#### Parameters:
- `domain`: Address family (AF_INET, AF_INET6, etc.)
- `type`: Socket type (SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_DGRAM, etc.)
- `protocol`: Protocol (typically 0 for default)

#### Common Usage:
```c
// Create TCP/IPv4 socket
int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

// Create UDP/IPv4 socket
int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
```

#### Return Value:
- Success: Returns a new socket descriptor (positive integer)
- Error: Returns -1 and sets errno

#### Notes:
- The socket created is initially not bound to any address
- The socket can't be used for communication until properly set up
- Protocol parameter is typically 0 because:
  - For AF_INET + SOCK_STREAM, TCP is the default/only protocol
  - For AF_INET + SOCK_DGRAM, UDP is the default/only protocol
- The socket descriptor is like a file descriptor and can be used with read/write operations after proper setup

### bind()

The `bind()` function associates a socket with a specific address.

```c
int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);
```

#### Parameters:
- `sockfd`: Socket descriptor returned by socket()
- `addr`: Pointer to address structure (sockaddr_in for IPv4)
- `addrlen`: Size of the address structure

#### Common Usage:
```c
struct sockaddr_in servaddr;
memset(&servaddr, 0, sizeof(servaddr));
servaddr.sin_family = AF_INET;
servaddr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);  // All interfaces
servaddr.sin_port = htons(8080);               // Port number

bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&servaddr, sizeof(servaddr));
```

#### Return Value:
- Success: Returns 0
- Error: Returns -1 and sets errno

#### Common Errors:
- EADDRINUSE: Address already in use
- EACCES: Permission denied (e.g., ports < 1024 require root)

#### Notes:
- Servers must explicitly bind sockets to well-known addresses so clients can find them
- Clients typically don't need to call bind() as the kernel assigns ephemeral ports during connect()
- Only one socket can be bound to a specific IP:port combination at a time

### listen()

The `listen()` function marks a socket as passive, able to accept incoming connections.

```c
int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);
```

#### Parameters:
- `sockfd`: Socket descriptor to make passive
- `backlog`: Maximum length of pending connection queue

#### Common Usage:
```c
listen(sockfd, 128);  // Allow up to 128 pending connections
```

#### Return Value:
- Success: Returns 0
- Error: Returns -1 and sets errno

#### Backlog Explained:
The backlog parameter limits the number of completed but not yet accepted connections. When this queue is full, new connection attempts receive "Connection refused."

In modern systems:
- Historical default was 5
- Common values are 128-512 for busy servers
- Maximum is often system-dependent (check SOMAXCONN)
- This queue acts as a buffer between connections arriving and your application accepting them

#### Notes:
- Must be called after `bind()` but before `accept()`
- Converts an active socket to a passive (listening) socket
- Only server sockets call `listen()`, not client sockets

### connect()

The `connect()` function establishes a connection to a server.

```c
int connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);
```

#### Parameters:
- `sockfd`: Client socket descriptor
- `addr`: Server's address to connect to
- `addrlen`: Size of the address structure

#### Common Usage:
```c
struct sockaddr_in servaddr;
memset(&servaddr, 0, sizeof(servaddr));
servaddr.sin_family = AF_INET;
servaddr.sin_port = htons(80);
inet_pton(AF_INET, "93.184.216.34", &servaddr.sin_addr);

connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&servaddr, sizeof(servaddr));
```

#### Return Value:
- Success: Returns 0
- Error: Returns -1 and sets errno

#### Common Errors:
- ECONNREFUSED: No server listening on the target port
- ETIMEDOUT: Connection attempt timed out
- ENETUNREACH: Network unreachable

#### Notes:
- For TCP sockets, initiates the three-way handshake
- Blocks until connection completes or error occurs
- If not explicitly bound, the kernel assigns a local address during connect
- Only client sockets use connect(); server sockets use accept()

### accept()

The `accept()` function accepts an incoming connection on a listening socket.

```c
int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen);
```

#### Parameters:
- `sockfd`: Listening socket descriptor
- `addr`: Will be filled with the client's address
- `addrlen`: Input: size of addr buffer; Output: actual size of client address

#### Common Usage:
```c
struct sockaddr_in client_addr;
socklen_t addr_len = sizeof(client_addr);
int connfd = accept(listenfd, (struct sockaddr *)&client_addr, &addr_len);
```

#### Return Value:
- Success: Returns a new socket descriptor for the accepted connection
- Error: Returns -1 and sets errno

#### Notes:
- Blocks until a connection request arrives
- Creates a new socket specifically for this client connection
- The original listening socket remains unchanged and can accept more connections
- The new socket inherits properties of the listening socket
- `addr_len` is both an input and output parameter:
  - Input: tells accept() how much space is available
  - Output: tells you how much data was actually written

#### Connection Queue:
- Connections that have completed TCP's three-way handshake but haven't been accepted yet sit in the queue
- The backlog parameter of listen() limits this queue's size
- When accept() returns, it removes the first connection from this queue

### getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo()

These functions provide a protocol-independent way to translate between hostnames, service names, and socket addresses.

#### getaddrinfo()

```c
int getaddrinfo(const char *node, const char *service,
                const struct addrinfo *hints,
                struct addrinfo **result);
```

##### Parameters:
- `node`: Hostname or IP address string (or NULL for server binding)
- `service`: Service name or port number as string
- `hints`: Preferences for what kind of socket addresses you want
- `result`: Pointer to linked list of results

##### Common Usage:
```c
struct addrinfo hints, *result;
memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints));
hints.ai_family = AF_INET;       // IPv4
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; // TCP
hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;     // For binding (server)

getaddrinfo(NULL, "8080", &hints, &result);
// result now contains address information for binding
```

##### Return Value:
- Success: Returns 0
- Error: Returns non-zero error code (use gai_strerror())

##### The hints Structure:
Key fields you can set:
- `ai_family`: Address family (AF_INET, AF_INET6, AF_UNSPEC)
- `ai_socktype`: Socket type (SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_DGRAM)
- `ai_protocol`: Protocol (typically left as 0)
- `ai_flags`: Additional options

Common flags:
- `AI_PASSIVE`: Address suitable for bind() (use with NULL hostname)
- `AI_CANONNAME`: Request canonical hostname
- `AI_NUMERICHOST`: Hostname must be numeric IP address

##### Result Structure:
```c
struct addrinfo {
    int              ai_flags;
    int              ai_family;
    int              ai_socktype;
    int              ai_protocol;
    socklen_t        ai_addrlen;
    struct sockaddr *ai_addr;
    char            *ai_canonname;
    struct addrinfo *ai_next;
};
```

This is a linked list because a single hostname might resolve to multiple addresses.

#### getnameinfo()

```c
int getnameinfo(const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen,
                char *host, socklen_t hostlen,
                char *service, socklen_t servicelen,
                int flags);
```

##### Parameters:
- `addr`: Socket address structure
- `addrlen`: Length of address structure
- `host`: Buffer for hostname (can be NULL)
- `hostlen`: Size of host buffer
- `service`: Buffer for service name (can be NULL)
- `servicelen`: Size of service buffer
- `flags`: Control flags

##### Common Usage:
```c
char hostname[NI_MAXHOST], service[NI_MAXSERV];

// After accept() fills client_addr
getnameinfo((struct sockaddr *)&client_addr, addr_len,
           hostname, NI_MAXHOST,
           service, NI_MAXSERV,
           0);

printf("Connection from %s:%s\n", hostname, service);
```

##### Return Value:
- Success: Returns 0
- Error: Returns non-zero error code (use gai_strerror())

##### Notes:
- Performs reverse DNS lookups if needed (can be slow)
- Useful for logging and diagnostics

#### Protocol Independence
These functions help write code that works with any IP version because:
1. They handle different address family formats internally
2. They return socket addresses ready for use with socket functions
3. You can specify AF_UNSPEC to get both IPv4 and IPv6 results
4. They handle conversion between hostnames and IP addresses

#### Error Handling
Unlike most socket functions, these don't use errno. Instead:
```c
int result = getaddrinfo("example.com", "80", &hints, &res);
if (result != 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo: %s\n", gai_strerror(result));
}
```

#### Memory Management
You must free the linked list when done:
```c
freeaddrinfo(result);
```

### Error Handling (errno)

Socket programming functions typically indicate errors by returning -1 and setting the global variable `errno` to indicate what went wrong.

#### How errno Works
`errno` is a global variable defined in `<errno.h>` that:
- Gets set by system calls and library functions when errors occur
- Has standardized error codes with specific meanings
- Each error code has a symbolic name (like ECONNREFUSED)
- Can be translated to human-readable messages

#### Common Socket Error Codes
- `EACCES`: Permission denied
- `EADDRINUSE`: Address already in use
- `ECONNREFUSED`: Connection refused
- `ETIMEDOUT`: Connection timed out
- `EBADF`: Bad file descriptor
- `EINVAL`: Invalid argument
- `EMFILE`: Too many open files (reached process limit)
- `ENFILE`: Too many open files (reached system limit)

#### Error Handling Functions
```c
// Prints "function_name: error message"
perror("function_name");

// Returns pointer to error message string
char *error_message = strerror(errno);
fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", error_message);
```

#### Example Error Handling Pattern
```c
int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
if (sockfd < 0) {
    perror("socket");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

if (bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&servaddr, sizeof(servaddr)) < 0) {
    perror("bind");
    close(sockfd);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

#### getaddrinfo() vs. errno
Unlike standard socket functions, `getaddrinfo()` and `getnameinfo()` have their own error handling mechanism:
- They return error codes directly, not -1 with errno
- Use `gai_strerror()` to convert these error codes to messages:

```c
int result = getaddrinfo(host, service, &hints, &res);
if (result != 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo: %s\n", gai_strerror(result));
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

## 3. Client-Server Model

The client-server model is a fundamental pattern in network programming where:
- Servers provide services (like web pages, files, database access)
- Clients request these services
- Communication follows specific protocols (like HTTP, FTP, etc.)

### Server Socket Setup

Setting up a server socket involves several steps:

#### 1. Create Socket
```c
int listenfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
if (listenfd < 0) {
    perror("socket");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

#### 2. Bind to Address
```c
struct sockaddr_in servaddr;
memset(&servaddr, 0, sizeof(servaddr));
servaddr.sin_family = AF_INET;
servaddr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);  // All interfaces
servaddr.sin_port = htons(8080);               // Port number

if (bind(listenfd, (struct sockaddr *)&servaddr, sizeof(servaddr)) < 0) {
    perror("bind");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

#### 3. Listen for Connections
```c
if (listen(listenfd, 128) < 0) {
    perror("listen");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

#### 4. Accept Connections (in a loop)
```c
while (1) {
    struct sockaddr_in clientaddr;
    socklen_t clientlen = sizeof(clientaddr);
    
    int connfd = accept(listenfd, (struct sockaddr *)&clientaddr, &clientlen);
    if (connfd < 0) {
        perror("accept");
        continue;  // Try again
    }
    
    // Handle client connection
    handle_client(connfd);
    close(connfd);
}
```

#### Using getaddrinfo()
A more protocol-independent approach:

```c
struct addrinfo hints, *res;
memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints));
hints.ai_family = AF_INET;       // IPv4
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; // TCP
hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE;     // For binding (server)

int status = getaddrinfo(NULL, "8080", &hints, &res);
if (status != 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo: %s\n", gai_strerror(status));
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

// Create socket using returned info
int listenfd = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype, res->ai_protocol);
if (listenfd < 0) {
    perror("socket");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

if (bind(listenfd, res->ai_addr, res->ai_addrlen) < 0) {
    perror("bind");
    close(listenfd);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

freeaddrinfo(res);  // Free when done
```

### Client Socket Setup

Setting up a client socket is simpler because clients don't need to bind to specific addresses:

#### 1. Create Socket
```c
int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
if (sockfd < 0) {
    perror("socket");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

#### 2. Connect to Server
```c
struct sockaddr_in servaddr;
memset(&servaddr, 0, sizeof(servaddr));
servaddr.sin_family = AF_INET;
servaddr.sin_port = htons(80);  // HTTP port
inet_pton(AF_INET, "93.184.216.34", &servaddr.sin_addr);

if (connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&servaddr, sizeof(servaddr)) < 0) {
    perror("connect");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

#### Using getaddrinfo()
A more flexible approach:

```c
struct addrinfo hints, *res;
memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints));
hints.ai_family = AF_INET;       // IPv4
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; // TCP

int status = getaddrinfo("www.example.com", "80", &hints, &res);
if (status != 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo: %s\n", gai_strerror(status));
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

// Try each address until we connect
struct addrinfo *p;
int sockfd;
for(p = res; p != NULL; p = p->ai_next) {
    sockfd = socket(p->ai_family, p->ai_socktype, p->ai_protocol);
    if (sockfd < 0) continue;
    
    if (connect(sockfd, p->ai_addr, p->ai_addrlen) == 0)
        break;  // Success!
        
    close(sockfd);
}

if (p == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to connect\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

freeaddrinfo(res);  // Free when done
```

### Ephemeral Ports

When a client creates a socket and connects to a server without explicitly binding to an address:

1. The kernel automatically assigns:
   - Local IP address (based on which network interface is used to reach the server)
   - Ephemeral port (temporary port number)

2. Characteristics of ephemeral ports:
   - Typically high-numbered (range often 32768-61000)
   - Assigned dynamically for outgoing connections
   - Temporary - released when connection closes
   - Uniquely identify client connections to servers

3. You rarely need to know or care about the specific ephemeral port assigned to your client socket, but it's important to understand that:
   - Every TCP connection is identified by a 4-tuple: (src IP, src port, dst IP, dst port)
   - The ephemeral port ensures each connection is unique
   - Servers can handle multiple clients from the same IP because each gets a different ephemeral port

4. You can explicitly bind a client socket if you need a specific local address, but this is rarely necessary:
```c
// Explicitly binding a client socket (uncommon)
struct sockaddr_in local_addr;
memset(&local_addr, 0, sizeof(local_addr));
local_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
local_addr.sin_port = htons(12345);  // Specific port
local_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);

if (bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&local_addr, sizeof(local_addr)) < 0) {
    perror("bind");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

### Connection Establishment

#### TCP Three-Way Handshake

When a TCP connection is established, a three-step process occurs:

1. **SYN (Synchronize)** - Client to Server:
   - Client sends a packet with SYN flag set
   - Includes an initial sequence number (ISN) X
   - "I want to establish a connection and will start numbering my bytes from X"

2. **SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge)** - Server to Client:
   - Server responds with SYN and ACK flags set
   - Acknowledges client's sequence number (X+1)
   - Sends its own initial sequence number Y
   - "I received your request to start from X, and I'll start from Y"

3. **ACK (Acknowledge)** - Client to Server:
   - Client sends packet with ACK flag set
   - Acknowledges server's sequence number (Y+1)
   - "I acknowledge your starting point Y, connection established!"

Once this exchange completes:
- Both sides have agreed on starting sequence numbers
- Connection is established (ESTABLISHED state)
- Data transfer can begin in both directions

#### Connection States and Queues

During connection establishment, a server maintains two queues:
1. **SYN Queue** (incomplete connections):
   - Connections in the SYN_RECEIVED state
   - Received SYN, sent SYN-ACK, waiting for ACK

2. **Accept Queue** (complete connections):
   - Connections that have completed the three-way handshake
   - Ready to be accepted by the application
   - This is the queue limited by the backlog parameter in listen()

When the accept queue is full:
- New connection attempts receive "Connection refused" errors
- Or in some implementations, the SYN is ignored (client retries)

The `accept()` function:
- Removes the oldest completed connection from the accept queue
- Creates a new socket for this specific connection
- Returns the new socket descriptor to the application

## 4. Network Protocol Layers

Network communication is organized into conceptual layers, each handling specific aspects of data transmission. The most common model is the TCP/IP model with four layers:

### Application Layer

This is the highest layer, where your application code operates.

**Responsibility:**
- Implement specific protocols for user applications
- Format data for specific services
- Handle communication patterns and logic

**Protocols:**
- HTTP/HTTPS (web)
- SMTP/IMAP/POP3 (email)
- FTP (file transfer)
- DNS (domain name resolution)
- SSH (secure shell)
- And many others

**Your Code's Role:**
- Uses socket API to create network connections
- Implements application-specific protocols
- Formats and interprets data
- Handles business logic

**Example Operations:**
```c
// Creating a socket (application layer operation)
sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

// Implementing HTTP protocol
char request[1024];
sprintf(request, "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.example.com\r\n\r\n");
write(sockfd, request, strlen(request));
```

When you're writing socket code, you're working at this layer, giving instructions that affect how the lower layers operate.

### Transport Layer

This layer handles process-to-process communication and is implemented in the operating system.

**Responsibility:**
- Addressing specific applications (via ports)
- Connection management (for TCP)
- Flow control
- Optional reliability guarantees

**Protocols:**
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
  - Connection-oriented
  - Reliable delivery
  - In-order delivery
  - Flow control
  
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
  - Connectionless
  - Best-effort delivery
  - No guarantees about order or delivery
  - Minimal overhead

**Operations (handled by OS):**
- Breaking data into segments
- Assigning sequence numbers (TCP)
- Managing connections (TCP)
- Adding checksum for error detection
- Handling retransmissions (TCP)

**Your Interaction:**
You choose which transport protocol to use when you create a socket:
```c
// TCP socket
sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

// UDP socket
sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
```

### Internet/Network Layer

This layer handles routing between different networks and is implemented by both the OS and network infrastructure.

**Responsibility:**
- Host-to-host delivery across networks
- Routing through intermediate nodes
- Addressing using IP addresses
- Fragmentation and reassembly

**Protocol:**
- **IP (Internet Protocol)**
  - IPv4 (32-bit addresses)
  - IPv6 (128-bit addresses)
  - Connectionless
  - Best-effort delivery

**Operations:**
- Adding IP headers with source/destination addresses
- Determining next hop via routing tables
- Fragmenting packets if they exceed MTU
- Handling TTL (Time To Live)

**Your Interaction:**
You specify the IP version when creating a socket:
```c
// IPv4
sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

// IPv6
sockfd = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
```

### Link Layer

This is the lowest layer, handling direct communication over physical media.

**Responsibility:**
- Physical transmission of data
- Media access control
- Physical addressing
- Error detection at physical level

**Protocols/Technologies:**
- Ethernet
- WiFi (802.11)
- PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)
- DSL, Cable, Fiber
- Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc.

**Operations:**
- Frame formatting
- Physical addressing (MAC addresses)
- Media access control
- Signal transmission
- Bit-level error detection

**Your Interaction:**
You generally don't directly interact with this layer in socket programming. Your OS and hardware handle these details automatically. However, some specialized applications might use raw sockets to access link-layer frames:
```c
// Raw socket (rare, requires root privileges)
raw_sockfd = socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(ETH_P_ALL));
```

## 5. Transport Protocols

### TCP: Connection-Oriented Communication

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides reliable, ordered, connection-oriented communication.

#### Key Characteristics

1. **Connection-Oriented**:
   - Requires explicit connection establishment (three-way handshake)
   - Maintains connection state throughout communication
   - Requires explicit connection termination (four-way handshake)

2. **Reliability Guarantees**:
   - Detects lost packets and retransmits them
   - Uses acknowledgments to confirm delivery
   - Checksums to detect corruption
   - Duplicate detection and elimination

3. **Ordered Delivery**:
   - Uses sequence numbers to ensure data arrives in order
   - Buffers out-of-order packets until missing packets arrive
   - Delivers data to application in the same order it was sent

4. **Flow Control**:
   - Prevents sender from overwhelming receiver
   - Uses sliding window mechanism
   - Receiver advertises window size (how much it can accept)

5. **Congestion Control**:
   - Prevents overwhelming the network
   - Adjusts sending rate based on network conditions
   - Implements algorithms like slow start, congestion avoidance

#### Socket Programming with TCP

In socket programming, TCP corresponds to `SOCK_STREAM`:

```c
int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
```

Key functions for TCP sockets:
- `connect()`: Establish connection (client)
- `listen()` + `accept()`: Accept connections (server)
- `send()`/`write()`: Send data
- `recv()`/`read()`: Receive data
- `close()`: Close connection

Typical TCP server pattern:
```c
socket() -> bind() -> listen() -> accept() -> read()/write() -> close()
```

Typical TCP client pattern:
```c
socket() -> connect() -> write()/read() -> close()
```

#### Common TCP Applications
- Web (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)
- File transfers (FTP)
- Remote login (SSH)
- Database connections

### UDP: Connectionless Communication

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) provides lightweight, connectionless communication with minimal overhead.

#### Key Characteristics

1. **Connectionless**:
   - No connection establishment or termination
   - No connection state maintained
   - Each packet (datagram) handled independently

2. **Best-Effort Delivery**:
   - No guarantee packets will arrive
   - No automatic retransmission of lost packets
   - Application must implement reliability if needed

3. **No Ordering Guarantees**:
   - Packets may arrive in different order than sent
   - No reordering of packets
   - Application must handle sequencing if order matters

4. **Low Overhead**:
   - Minimal header (8 bytes vs. 20+ for TCP)
   - No connection setup/teardown
   - No connection state tracking

5. **Message-Oriented**:
   - Preserves message boundaries (unlike TCP's byte stream)
   - One `sendto()` call = one `recvfrom()` call (if successful)

#### Socket Programming with UDP

In socket programming, UDP corresponds to `SOCK_DGRAM`:

```c
int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
```

Key functions for UDP sockets:
- `sendto()`: Send datagram to specific address
- `recvfrom()`: Receive datagram and sender's address
- `bind()`: Bind to local address (needed for servers, optional for clients)

Typical UDP server pattern:
```c
socket() -> bind() -> recvfrom()/sendto() -> close()
```

Typical UDP client pattern:
```c
socket() -> [optional bind()] -> sendto()/recvfrom() -> close()
```

#### Common UDP Applications
- DNS (Domain Name System)
- Streaming media
- VoIP (Voice over IP)
- Online games
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- Simple monitoring tools

### Protocol Comparison

| Feature | TCP | UDP |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Connection | Connection-oriented | Connectionless |
| Reliability | Guaranteed delivery | Best-effort delivery |
| Ordering | Guaranteed in-order delivery | No ordering guarantees |
| Data Boundaries | Byte stream (no boundaries) | Datagram boundaries preserved |
| Flow Control | Yes | No |
| Congestion Control | Yes | No |
| Speed | Slower due to overhead | Faster, minimal overhead |
| Header Size | 20-60 bytes | 8 bytes |
| Usage | When reliability is critical | When speed/low latency is critical |

#### When to Use TCP
- When you need guaranteed delivery
- When data must arrive in order
- For applications that require all data to be correctly received
- When the consequences of data loss are significant
- Examples: file transfers, web browsing, database access

#### When to Use UDP
- When speed is more important than reliability
- When some data loss is acceptable
- When low latency is critical
- For broadcast/multicast needs
- For simple request-response interactions
- Examples: live streaming, online gaming, IoT sensors

## 6. Advanced Server Architectures

### Sequential Servers

The simplest server design handles one client at a time.

#### Characteristics
- Processes one client connection to completion before accepting another
- Simple to implement
- No concurrency concerns
- Suitable only for very light loads or testing

#### Implementation Pattern
```c
while (1) {
    // Wait for a client connection
    connfd = accept(listenfd, (struct sockaddr *)&client_addr, &addr_len);
    
    // Handle this client (blocks until complete)
    handle_client(connfd);
    
    // Close connection when done
    close(connfd);
}
```

#### Limitations
- All clients except the currently active one are blocked
- Poor utilization of server resources
- Unacceptable for production use with multiple clients
- Extremely limited scalability

### Concurrent Servers

Concurrent servers handle multiple clients simultaneously.

#### Process-per-Connection Model

```c
while (1) {
    connfd = accept(listenfd, (struct sockaddr *)&client_addr, &addr_len);
    
    // Create a child process for this connection
    if (fork() == 0) {
        // Child process
        close(listenfd);  // Child doesn't need the listening socket
        handle_client(connfd);
        close(connfd);
        exit(0);  // Child exits
    }
    
    // Parent process
    close(connfd);  // Parent doesn't need this connection socket
}
```

**Pros**:
- Simple conceptual model
- Full isolation between connections
- OS handles scheduling

**Cons**:
- Process creation is expensive
- High memory overhead (each process has its own memory space)
- Limited by system process limits
- Interprocess communication is complicated if needed

#### Thread-per-Connection Model

```c
void *thread_function(void *arg) {
    int connfd = *((int *)arg);
    free(arg);  // Free the memory for the socket descriptor
    
    handle_client(connfd);
    close(connfd);
    return NULL;
}

// Main thread
while (1) {
    connfd = accept(listenfd, (struct sockaddr *)&client_addr, &addr_len);
    
    // Create argument for thread
    int *thread_arg = malloc(sizeof(int));
    *thread_arg = connfd;
    
    // Create thread for this connection
    pthread_t thread_id;
    pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, thread_function, thread_arg);
    pthread_detach(thread_id);  // Don't need to join
}
```

**Pros**:
- Lower overhead than processes
- Shared memory space (easier communication between threads)
- Faster thread creation than process creation

**Cons**:
- Requires careful synchronization for shared resources
- Thread safety concerns
- Still has overhead for thread creation
- Limited by system thread limits

#### Thread Pool Model

```c
// Simplified thread pool example
#define NUM_THREADS 16
int connection_queue[QUEUE_SIZE];
pthread_mutex_t queue_mutex;
pthread_cond_t queue_cond;

void *worker_thread(void *arg) {
    while (1) {
        int connfd;
        
        // Get connection from queue
        pthread_mutex_lock(&queue_mutex);
        while (queue_is_empty()) {
            pthread_cond_wait(&queue_cond, &queue_mutex);
        }
        connfd = dequeue_connection();
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&queue_mutex);
        
        // Handle client
        handle_client(connfd);
        close(connfd);
    }
    return NULL;
}

// Main thread
void initialize_thread_pool() {
    pthread_t thread_id;
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, worker_thread, NULL);
        pthread_detach(thread_id);
    }
}

// Accept connections and add to queue
while (1) {
    connfd = accept(listenfd, (struct sockaddr *)&client_addr, &addr_len);
    
    pthread_mutex_lock(&queue_mutex);
    enqueue_connection(connfd);
    pthread_cond_signal(&queue_cond);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&queue_mutex);
}
```

**Pros**:
- Reuses threads instead of creating new ones
- Controls resource usage (fixed number of threads)
- Better performance under high load
- More scalable

**Cons**:
- More complex implementation
- Requires careful tuning of pool size
- Need to manage connection queue

### High-Performance Techniques

For handling massive numbers of concurrent connections (thousands to millions):

#### Event-driven Architecture (Non-blocking I/O)

The event-driven model uses non-blocking I/O and event notifications to handle many connections with few threads.

```c
// Simplified event loop using select()
fd_set read_fds;
int max_fd = listenfd;
int client_sockets[MAX_CLIENTS];

while (1) {
    // Set up file descriptor set
    FD_ZERO(&read_fds);
    FD_SET(listenfd, &read_fds);
    
    // Add active clients to set
    for (int i = 0; i < num_clients; i++) {
        FD_SET(client_sockets[i], &read_fds);
        max_fd = (client_sockets[i] > max_fd) ? client_sockets[i] : max_fd;
    }
    
    // Wait for activity on any socket
    if (select(max_fd + 1, &read_fds, NULL, NULL, NULL) < 0) {
        perror("select");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    
    // Check for new connections
    if (FD_ISSET(listenfd, &read_fds)) {
        connfd = accept(listenfd, (struct sockaddr *)&client_addr, &addr_len);
        add_to_clients(connfd);
    }
    
    // Check existing connections
    for (int i = 0; i < num_clients; i++) {
        if (FD_ISSET(client_sockets[i], &read_fds)) {
            handle_client_data(client_sockets[i]);
        }
    }
}
```

Modern implementations use more efficient alternatives to `select()`:
- `poll()`: Simpler interface, no fixed limit on number of fds
- `epoll()` (Linux): Highly efficient, O(1) complexity
- `kqueue()` (BSD/macOS): Similar to epoll
- `IOCP` (Windows): Completion-based rather than readiness-based

**Pros**:
- Can handle thousands of connections with few threads
- Efficient resource usage
- Excellent scalability
- Lower memory overhead

**Cons**:
- Complex programming model
- Callback-based code can be harder to understand
- Must ensure no operations block
- Different implementations across platforms

#### Asynchronous I/O

More advanced than event-driven, asynchronous I/O delegates I/O operations to the OS completely:

```c
// Linux aio example (simplified)
struct aiocb cb;
char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];

// Set up asynchronous read request
memset(&cb, 0, sizeof(cb));
cb.aio_fildes = sockfd;
cb.aio_buf = buffer;
cb.aio_nbytes = BUFFER_SIZE;
cb.aio_sigevent.sigev_notify = SIGEV_THREAD;
cb.aio_sigevent.sigev_notify_function = callback_function;

// Submit read request
aio_read(&cb);

// Continue doing other work while I/O happens in background
```

**Pros**:
- Even better scalability than event-driven
- Can take advantage of OS-specific optimizations
- Truly non-blocking I/O operations

**Cons**:
- Most complex programming model
- Limited standardization
- Platform-specific implementations
- Steep learning curve

#### Zero-Copy I/O

Eliminates unnecessary copying of data between kernel and user space:

```c
// Using sendfile() to transmit file without copying to user space
off_t offset = 0;
sendfile(client_sockfd, file_fd, &offset, file_size);
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduced CPU usage
- Reduced memory bandwidth usage
- Improved throughput for large data transfers
- Especially useful for static content servers

#### Connection Management Techniques

1. **Connection pooling**:
   - Maintain a pool of pre-established connections
   - Avoid connection setup/teardown overhead
   - Common in database servers

2. **Keep-alive connections**:
   - Allow multiple requests over single connection
   - Set appropriate timeouts
   - Modern HTTP uses this by default

3. **Load balancing**:
   - Distribute connections across multiple server instances
   - Can be round-robin, least-connections, or weighted

4. **Connection rate limiting**:
   - Prevent denial-of-service attacks
   - Ensure fair resource allocation

#### Memory and Resource Management

1. **Memory pools**:
   - Pre-allocate memory in pools
   - Avoid fragmentation
   - Faster than malloc/free for similarly sized objects

2. **Buffer management**:
   - Reuse buffers 
   - Right-size buffers for expected traffic
   - Consider scatter-gather I/O for non-contiguous buffers

3. **Resource limits**:
   - Set appropriate limits on file descriptors (ulimit)
   - Monitor and control memory usage
   - Implement graceful degradation under load

When building your concurrent web server, you'll likely start with a simpler thread-per-connection or thread pool model before possibly moving to event-driven architecture for maximum scalability.
